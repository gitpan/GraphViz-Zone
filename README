Status:

First release of GraphViz::Zone.  Suggestions/bug reports/patches
greatly appreciated.

Description:

This perl module is an parser/grapher for BIND Zone files.  It will
parse a user-supplied .zone file and output a .png of the nodes in
the zone along with their IPs and any TXT information registered.

Installation:

This module needs Leon Brocard's GraphViz module, available from the
CPAN.  It also needs the GraphViz programs that GraphViz.pm wraps,
available from http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/ .

Usual CPAN installation rules apply:

        perl Makefile.PL 
        make
	make test
        make install

There is documentation - including sample usage - in Zone.pm itself.
